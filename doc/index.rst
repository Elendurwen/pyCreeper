pyCreeper 2.1
############################

**Welcome! pyCreeper is a python library that lets you create pretty graphs in python with one-line function calls.**

The main purpose of pyCreeper is to wrap tens of lines of python code, required to produce graphs that look good for a publication, into functions. It takes away your need to understand various quirks of matplotlib and gives you back ready-to-use and well-documented code.
